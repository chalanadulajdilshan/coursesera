I was lucky enough to be involved in this valuable opportunity at that time when our precious time is being wasted due to the corona outbreak. This greatly helped me to develop subject-related knowledge and soft skills such as leadership, communication skills, and digital literacy, etc. I have completed more than 30 courses including specialization in Human resource management, Project management, English communication, MS excel, Cad, and digital manufacturing. Those skills will be very important for me in the CV and career development. I was thankful to the national library of Sri Lanka, Commonwealth of learning Canada, and Coursera for this priceless opportunity. I would like to offer my best wishes to the national library of Srilanka to continue such valuable social services.</p>

I thank National Library of Sri Lanka and Commonwealth of Learning Canada and Coursera for offering these valuable university courses for free of charge at this critical period. 

                                                I have started learning via Coursera since June 2020. Since then I have gone through many lecture lessons from reputed universities [40+] across the world. I have gained enormous knowledge and insights by going through these lecture sessions and by doing the question papers and assignments.
                                                Being an employee, my main constraint and challenge was the time factor. However I managed to go through the lessons conducted by experts in the field and did my best to achieve my goal to complete the highest number of courses. At times I found this as a challenging task and my keen effort has paved me good dividend. Each day I have spent at least 6-8 Hours learning lessons and doing online exams. Finally I have completed 1144 courses in 40+ universities across 14 nations. This includes several specialization courses from reputed universities. I have spent 2000+ hours during this learning process. I have covered major learning areas such as Finance, Sales and Marketing, Health Care, Market Research and Research Management, Human Resources, Strategic Management, Project Management, Information Technology, Leadership, Risk Mitigation and Governance, Law and Order, Supply Chain Management, Climate Change, Psychology, International Business, History, Tourism, Accounting etc.

                                                I have learned new lessons, new theories, new methodologies which enhanced my knowledge and skills. I use more MS Office [Excel/Presentation etc.], Accounting, Formulas [Ratios/Spread sheets etc.] during day to day work. Hence the techniques learned from these courses are really helpful and I am applying them in my day to day work.

                                                Further, I have gained more in-depth understanding in leadership skills, problem solving skills, emotional intelligence skills, creative thinking etc. This is useful for me when I am engaged with internal and external stakeholders.

Due to very busy work schedules I was not able to participate in any career development or skills development learning programs. I could not move forward as a banker because my educational qualifications were only covered by business management aspects. As a result, I stagnated in my career.
                                                Skills Online Programme gave me a good chance to get out of this situation. In addition to the scholarship offered, the online learning method and its flexibility are more advantageous to busy people like me. I have completed a number of courses offered by reputed universities in finance, investment banking, ICT, marketing and English language which are essential to move forward. I have already submitted my course certificates to the Management and they agreed to consider my promotion next year.

                                            <p class="mb-30"> I am among the fortunate Sri Lankans who received the rare opportunity to learn on Coursera collaborated with Commonwealth of Learning. I was able to complete most of the courses like Lean Six Sigma which I was not able to complete due to time constraints and financial capability. All together I was able to complete 80+ courses and the best thing is we are able to list them on our LinkedIn. I was able to increase the value of my Resume within a short period of time and I received many employment opportunities with many employers not only in Sri Lanka but also from abroad. The learning journey never ends and it is always time to capitalize on ourselves. I would like to thank National Library of Sri Lanka for this opportunity and everyone who has responsibility to make not only my dream but each and everyone’s dream a reality. </p>

Without the necessary skills and knowledge, one cannot survive in this profession – especially in an academic setting! The courses I followed (i.e. Introduction to Research Writing, Information & Digital Literacy for University Success, Academic Information Seeking and Information Security etc.) advanced my theoretical knowledge and also enhanced my soft skills. I am now equipped with the skills needed to serve the academic community in a more efficient and innovative way. On the other hand it helps me manage my future career aspirations and boost my employment prospects. In my experience I recommend this series of courses to anyone who needs to develop their own skills and knowledge. My sincere thanks to NLSL-COL-Coursera 'Skills Online Sri Lanka' program.</p>
